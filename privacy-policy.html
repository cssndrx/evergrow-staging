        <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
        <h3>Methods of processing</h3>

The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.</p>

        <ul role="list">
          <li>Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases.
