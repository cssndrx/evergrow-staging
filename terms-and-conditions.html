        <h2>Common provisions</h2>
        <h3>No Waiver</h3>

        <p>To learn more about the use of their Personal Data, Users may refer to the privacy policy of this Website.</p>
        <h3>Intellectual property rights</h3>
        <p>Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to this Website are the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties relating to intellectual property.</p>

        <h3>Changes to these Terms</h3>
        <p>The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of these changes.</p>
        <p>Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User for the future.</p>
        <p>The continued use of the Service will signify the User’s acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service. Failure to accept the revised Terms, may entitle either party to terminate the Agreement.</p>
        <p>The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User&#x27;s acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from the Owner.</p>
        <p>If required by applicable law, the Owner will specify the date by which the modified Terms will enter into force.</p>
        <h3>Assignment of contract</h3>

        <h4>US Users</h4>
        <p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h4>EU Users</h4>
        <p>Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.<br>In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.</p>
        <p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>
        <h3>Governing law</h3>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.</p>

        <h3>Venue of jurisdiction</h3>

        <p>The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European Consumers, nor to Consumers based in Switzerland, Norway or Iceland.</p>
